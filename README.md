# Unhandled File Processing Error in Shell Script

This repository demonstrates a common error in shell scripting: unhandled errors during file processing. The script `bug.sh` attempts to process a file but lacks proper error handling.  If the file is not found or processing fails, the script silently continues, which can lead to unexpected results or data loss.

The improved solution, `bugSolution.sh`, demonstrates proper error handling using exit codes and more informative error messages. This ensures the script terminates gracefully when an error occurs and provides clear feedback to the user.
